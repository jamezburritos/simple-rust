# simple-rust
A series of simple rust programs used to learn the language over time.
list adapted from a post found [here](https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/3473/).

## beginner
- [x] find the factorial of a given number.
- [x] convert between two currencies.
- [x] print out the following pyramids, given a maximum number of *s.

```
- [x] use a randomly generated number to select 1 of 3 (or more) functions to show the user. 
- [x] guessing game: ask the user to guess a number between 0 and a 100. tell the user if their guess is correct, too high, or too low.
- [x] generate fibonacci numbers <= a given value.
- [x] determine the number of characters and vowels in a given line of text.
- [x] find the fifth root of the sum of the squares of the first 100 odd numbers. 
- [x] list all possible combinations of letters in a word.
- [x] get the radius, diameter, or area of the circle from the user, then calculate the missing values. 
- [x] read a line of text and write it out backwards. use a recursive function. 
- [x] swap the contents of 3 variables without using any temporary (or extra) variables. 
- [x] reverse the digits of an integer, that is 326 becomes 623, etc. 
- [x] simple calculator: accept a two-number operation and output the solution. implement at least +-*/.
- [x] determine the total dollar value of a number of 50c, 25c, 10c and 5c coins, given how many of each coin there are in a piggy-bank.
- [x] check if a given string is a palindrome (a string which is the same both forwards and backwards). consider only alphanumeric characters and ignore case.
- [x] input an indefinite number of a student's scores and their percentage weights. calculate and output their weighted average.

## intermediate
- [x] output all the pairs of prime numbers whose sum equals a given number.
- [x] fetch a series of question/answer pairs from a file. allow the user to take the quiz, count the number of correct answers and output their final score. 
- [x] write a program which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication of matrices. the dimensions of both the matrices would be specified by the user (dynamic memory allocation required). use of structure or a class to define the matrix would be a good idea. 
- [x] implement your own version of 'mv' to move a file to another path. accept the paths as command-line arguments. 
- [ ] implement the linked-list data structure. nodes should be able to be inserted and deleted anywhere in the list, and the list should be traversable in both directions. 
- [ ] implement your own database. use a hard-coded schema and store the data in a binary file. do not use external libraries. 
- [ ] create a quine: a program that prints out its own source code.

## expert
- [ ] implement your own version of [`strstr()`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).
- [ ] implement a to-do list. allow the user to store tasks and notes. data must persist between sessions.
- [ ] implement the game tic-tac-toe.
- [ ] implement a file encryption/decryption program. accept a file as an argument and use a custom file header to determine whether the file needs to be encrypted or decrypted.
- [ ] implement a data structure to model the standard 52 playing cards. use it to develop a playable version of your favourite card game.
- [ ] implement a data structure to model a standard chess board. then use it to develop a playable game of chess.
- [ ] implement the binary-tree data structure. nodes should be able to be inserted and deleted anywhere in the tree. the tree should be sortable, searchable, and traverable both depth and breadth first.

## graphics
- [ ] draw a rectangle, ellipse, square, circle, point or line based on user input. 
- [ ] implement a simple drawing program. it should be possible to switch between different tools (circle, rectangle, eraser...) using pre-defined key strokes. 
- [ ] plot a simple graph for a hard-coded function f(x). it should be possible to zoom in on any part of the graph.
- [ ] write a program to plot a graph of given equation of form y=f(x) and a range for x as command line arguments. (e.g. my_graph_plotter -eq="y=x*x" -xmin=-10, -xmax=10) - expert. (ps: more to do with equation solving than graphics)
- [ ] implement the classic game brick-breaker.
